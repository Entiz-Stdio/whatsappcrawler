Uses [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/), a web automation framework to do all the heavy lifting


## Installation

pip install selenium
```
## Remarks
 I have added only the functionality for chrome browser Version.76.0.3809.132, if you wish to add other browsers download respective drivers from [here](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/).
